# 👋, I'm Oriol

I am a Software Engineer based in Barcelona ❤️. My passion is to transform ideas into products for the market. I love to find creative ways to solve **problems** to exponentially improve our lives.

**C-level** since 2012 (excluding a couple of occasions), being **CTO** and **CPO**, and sometimes starting companies as a **Founder** 💪. Now I'm doing my best as **Director of Engineering** at [Factorial](https://factorialhr.com/) 💜.

I'm a strong advocate of having **Side Projects**. I always try to have at least one to feed my appetite for playing with some new tech and learning new stuff. I try to make them **profitable** but so far I haven't been very lucky 🌝💰.

But above all, I'm a family man: Happily married and blessed father of 2 *little lions* 🦁🦁.

Now I build stuff @ [Factorial](https://factorialhr.com/),  previously at [Quipu](https://getquipu.com/),  [Billy Mobile](https://billymob.com/en/),  Kerad Games,  **Crows & Dogs**,  [Fever](https://feverup.com/),  [Ideaknow](http://ideaknow.com/),  Tupply,  Soma Barcelona and [TMB](https://www.tmb.cat/es/home) (*Lol I'm too old* 👴🏻).

I always enjoy having a chat,  so don't hesitate to send me an [email](mailto:hi@oriol.dev) or drop me a message on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oriolblanc/).
